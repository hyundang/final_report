      "Passage: America is the Saudi Arabia of Coal Plant fossils of West Virginia are examples of the fossil flora that comprise the vast coal reserves that are typical in the Eastern United States. Coal is formed from ancient plant material accumulating over long periods of time in swamp conditions so devoid of oxygen that bacteria could not exist to cause decay. Being composed almost entirerly of plant fossils, coal is in effect concentrated sunlight, and is one of our most important fossil fuels. The United States as a whole has more recoverable coal resources than any other country on the planet-- over 262 billion tons-- enough to last over 200 years!\n",

Then the protein passes through the golgi apparatus, where it is packaged into a vesicle. In the vesicle, more parts are cut off, and it turns into mature insulin. Post-translational modification (PTM) refers to the covalent and generally enzymatic modification of proteins during or after protein biosynthesis.

Although oxygen is not used as the final electron acceptor, the process still uses a respiratory electron transport chain; it is respiration without oxygen. In aerobic organisms undergoing respiration, electrons are shuttled to an electron transport chain, and the final electron acceptor is oxygen. Molecular oxygen is a highly oxidizing agent and, therefore, is an excellent acceptor.\n",

In aerobic respiration, NADH loses its electrons to proteins embedded in the inner mitochondrial membranes.
